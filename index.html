      <h1>Brandon Sanderson's Cosmere</h1>

         <div id = 'overview'><h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>Brandon Sanderson is a Fantasy/Sci-Fi writer who is most well known for his multiple series all taking place within the same shared universe, known as the Cosmere.
               Currently there are five different series, consisting of twelve full novels, three graphic novels, and nine novellas/short stories, with many more to come.
               Each of these series takes place on a different planet within the Cosmere. On the surface, this may sound very sci-fi-esque, but space travel is (currently) non-existent.
            </p>   
            <p>Each planet has its own magic system based on the god, or gods, that inhabit the world. There are sixteen gods in total, all who were once a group of people that conspired to
               destroy the original god. In doing so, they each took a piece or aspect of the original god. One became Honor. Another Preservation. Another Cultivation. 
               Not all aspects were good though. One became Ruin and another, probably the most nefarious, became Odium.
            </p>   
            <p>Very few people within the Cosmere know of the full extent of the backdrop in which they live. Each series slowly reveals more information about 
               the Cosmere as a whole. These books and series can easily and enjoyable be read on their own without worrying about the wider Cosmere as a whole, though 
               Sanderson is slowly building to a universe-wide clash.
            </p>
            <p>Anyway, here is a non-exhaustive overview of the series in Brandon Sanderson's masterwork:</p>

         <h2>Mistborn</h2>
            <p>The <em>Mistborn</em> series takes place on the planet Scadriel. The skies of Scadriel rain ash all day and mists occlude the nights.
               On Scadriel, magic is channeled through the comsuming and "burning" of metals.
               Each metal corresponds to a different magical ability. For instance, the buring of Tin increases the senses. Pewter increases strength and physical fortitude.
               Iron allows users to "pull" on a metal object, bring it towards them, or if it is much larger, bring them towards it. Burning Steel does the opposite.
               This is less than half of the known metals. One thousand years ago, the Lord Ruler defeated an infathomable evil called the Deepness and established 
               the Final Empire, and has reigned immortally ever since. Mistborn takes place in (currently) two eras, the second taking place 300 years after the first.

         <h2>The Stormlight Archive</h2>
            <p><em>The Stormlight Archive</em> series takes place on the planet Roshar. Most of the life on Roshar seems to have evolved from insects, with carapace and many legs,
               except for the humans. A giant storm rounds the planet constantly, bringing rain, clay, and magical light. The magic system on Roshar is channeled through Stormlight. 
               And a magical connection with beings called Spren - embodiments of human emotion and beliefs. Long ago on Roshar, there were constant wars between 
               humans and the Voidbringers - creatures of legend that invaded Roshar. The humans were led by the ten Heralds and their orders of Knights Radiant - 
               knights in resplendent armor with magical blades.
               But after countless years fighting back the evil, the Heralds brought an end to the fighting and peace has reigned for four and a half thousand years.

         <div id = 'warbreaker'>
         <h2>Warbreaker</h2>
            <p><em>Warbreaker</em> takes place on the planet Nalthis. Due to the fact that there is only one novel, so far, in the Warbreaker series, not much is known 
               about Nalthis other than its magic system and a few kingdoms. Magic on Nalthis derives from Divine Breath, which is powered by color. Each person 
               is born with one Breath, but accumlating more results in heightened senses and the ability to bring other things to life through commands. The "gods" of 
               the kingdom Hallandren are people who have died and been brought back to life by a Divine Breath, having no knowledge of their previous life. 
               The kingdoms of Idris and Hallandren have been rivals for centuries, but tensions are growing as a princess of Idris is sent off to marry the God King 
               of Hallandren.

         <div id = 'elantris'>
         <h2>Elantris</h2>
            <p><em>Elantris</em> takes place on the planet Sel. Like Warbreaker, there is currently only one novel in this series, though more are planned. 
            The magic system of Sel is more varied than the others, and is based on symbols, shapes, or forms to direct the use of the magic. The name of the novel 
            comes from the once grand glowing city of Elantris, where magical silver beings called Elantrians lived. These were normal people who wake up one day, skin silver and 
            magical. But ten years prior to the novel, Elantris suddenly fell into ruin. Its inhabitants driven mad and its glory, and glow, faded. Now when people wake 
            up an Elantrian, they are shunned and thrown into the ruins of the once grand city. Now the prince of the nearby kingdom of Arelon wakes to find himself changed 
            into an Elantrian.

         <h2>White Sand</h2>
            <p><em>White Sand</em> is a series of three graphic novels that takes place on the planet of Taldain. Taldain is a tidally locked planet, with one 
            side perpetually day and the other perpetually night.
